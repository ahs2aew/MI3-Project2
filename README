##Contents 
This repository contains materials relevant to DS 4002, "Data Science Project Course", this project aims to assess the sentiment of different newspaper articles on different political candidates. Our hypothesis focuses on determining whether there is an actual difference in sentiment between the different newspapers categorized based on their political leanings when they talk about certain political candidates.  This repository will include the source folder, data used, figures produced, and references that were used.

##SRC Section 
Installing and building the code: To run code download the excel file from Kaggle’https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snapcrack/all-the-news’ and save it in the same workspace as the MI2-DS4002-Project2.Rmd file. Once the workspace is set to the directory you saved the Rmd file in, you are able to run the code directly from the rmd file.

Using the code: You will be able to run the Rmd file, which will manipulate and clean the dataframe and produce the visualizations.
